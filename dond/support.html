<h1>Drink or no Drink!</h1>

<b>1. Choose Your Box:</b> The player selects one box to keep unopened until the end of the game. They will have the option of opening this box at the end of the game.
<br>
<b>2. Eliminate Boxes:</b> The player eliminates boxes from play. Every box removed reveals its reward or forfeit.
<br>
<b>3. The Banker's Offer:</b> After every 5 boxes are eliminated, it's time for the "Banker's call." Here, the other players (acting as the Banker) propose an offer based on the remaining boxes. This offer could be a reward or forfeit.
<br>
<u>Deal or No Deal:</u>
<br>
<b>Accept the Deal:</b> If you accept the Banker's offer, the game ends, and you must do the accepted reward or forfeit.
<br>
<b>Reject the Deal:</b> If you choose "No Deal," the game continues. Keep removing boxes until the next Banker's call.
<br>
<b>4. Ending the Game:</b> The game ends for a player when they accept a Banker's offer or when the final box is chosen. The player then receives the reward or performs the forfeit inside their chosen box.
<br><br>
At any point in the game you can press the list of rewards on the sides of the screen to see their descriptions. This is particularly useful when the banker is giving a deal!
